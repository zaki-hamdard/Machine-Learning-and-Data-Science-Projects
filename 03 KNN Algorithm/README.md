## Customer Category Prediction Notebook

### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth analysis and prediction of customer categories based on various customer features using Python. It covers the entire workflow of a data science project including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, model building, and evaluation.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is `teleCust1000t.csv`, which includes features like region, tenure, age, and income, along with a target variable categorizing customer types.

### Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

### Steps to Run the Notebook
1. Ensure that Python and Jupyter are installed on your machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Load the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially.

### Model
The notebook implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict customer categories. It also evaluates the model using accuracy metrics to understand performance.

### Results
The model's performance is discussed with insights on potential improvements and the impact of feature relationships on the model's accuracy.

### Conclusion
This analysis highlights the importance of feature selection and model tuning in predictive accuracy. Future work may explore more sophisticated algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

### Acknowledgments
The dataset and initial setup guidelines were provided as part of an educational project in data science.
